<h2>Examples</h2>

<menu from-current-page="true" show-excerpt="true"></menu>

<!--
form over multiple tabs:
    how to deal with validation errors on other tabs.
    save per tab, but required field on other tab.
    wizard option - have to step through all steps to get to save button

long text:
    collapsible headings:
    if you collapse on open, user has to open headings to read them. ok if user looking for specific info,
    not when reading all the way through (novel, manual). if expand on open, user still overwelmed.
    by using separate menu, user can read unimpeded while using menu for orientation and getting an overview.
